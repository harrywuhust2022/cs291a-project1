# cs291a-project1
Project 1 of CS291A in 2023 Fall quarter. Aim to learn and use the Ruby programming language.

# Summary
When doing this project, I have encountered several problems. At first, I tried to install ruby on Windows and run the tests. However, this will trigger the random segmentation errors. And then, I installed the ruby 3.2.2 on Linux system and I surprisingly found that this version will also cause the segmentation errors. Then I saw the post on Piazza that we should avoid the 3.2.2 version. After that, I degrade the ruby version to 3.0.6 on the Linux system. And here is a valuable installation website:
